# Emoji-Memory-Game
## The game 
Two players take turns choosing a set of ‘cards.  If the two emojis match, the player receives a point on his/her scoreboard. The game is over if there are no more cards to choose from or if a player reaches a score of ten.  

## Game rules and process 

* Game begins when player clicks start. Until then the cards are disabled, but not greyed out. A message box shows whose turn it is.  

* Player One chooses a set of two cards. If they match, the cards change colors and are then removed. Player One receives a point on his/her scoreboard.  

* If the cards chosen do not match, the cards turn back over, and it is Player Two’s turn.  

* The same process follows for the next player until the game is over.  

* If a player reaches a score of 10 points or there are no more cards left to choose from, the game is over, and the winner is displayed.
